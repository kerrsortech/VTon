### ✅ 3. Edge Case Handling

**Image Quality Edge Cases:**
- Very large images (validated and handled)
- Very small images (detected and rejected)
- Unsupported formats (validated and rejected)
- Corrupted files (detected early)

**Product Category Edge Cases:**
- Unknown categories → Fallback to category defaults
- Unsupported categories → Mapped to nearest supported type
- Low-quality Gemini analysis → Automatic fallback to category configs

**Body Reconstruction Edge Cases:**
- Head-only photos + footwear → Full body reconstruction
- Head-only photos + clothing → Upper body reconstruction
- Upper-body photos + lower-body items → Full body extension
- Automatic detection and appropriate reconstruction

**API Failure Edge Cases:**
- Gemini analysis fails → Category defaults used
- Replicate API fails → Clear error with retry guidance
- Blob storage fails → Error caught and reported
- Timeout scenarios → Handled gracefully

### ✅ 4. Prompt Quality Assurance

**Production Enhancements:**
- **Facial Fidelity Enforcement**: Explicit instructions to preserve exact facial features
- **Product Fidelity Enforcement**: Instructions to reproduce product exactly
- **Single Person Enforcement**: Multiple layers of enforcement throughout prompt
- **Body Reconstruction Instructions**: Category-aware reconstruction when needed
- **Prompt Validation**: Quality checks before sending to image generation
- **Sanitization**: All user inputs sanitized to prevent prompt injection

### ✅ 5. Category-Specific Optimizations

**All Supported Categories Handled:**
- **HEADWEAR** (Sunglasses, Caps, Hats): Head-and-shoulders, face-focused
- **FOOTWEAR** (Shoes, Sneakers, Boots): Full-body mandatory, feet in foreground
- **CLOTHING_UPPER** (T-Shirts, Jackets, etc.): Three-quarter body, balanced focus
- **CLOTHING_LOWER** (Pants, Jeans, Shorts): Full-body mandatory
- **CLOTHING_FULL** (Dresses, Jumpsuits): Full-body with garment focus
- **ACCESSORY_BODY** (Watches, Jewelry): Mid-shot or head-and-shoulders
- **ACCESSORY_CARRY** (Bags): Bag-type specific (handbag, shoulder, crossbody, backpack, etc.)
- **ACCESSORY_OTHER** (Belts, Scarves, Gloves): Appropriate framing per type

### ✅ 6. Bag Category Specialization

**Bag Type Detection:**
- Handbags → Held in hand or on forearm
- Clutches → Held in hand or tucked under arm
- Shoulder Bags → On shoulder, strap visible
- Crossbody Bags → Diagonally across body
- Backpacks → On back, straps over shoulders
- Tote Bags → Held by handles or on shoulder
- Belt Bags → Around waist/hips

**Automatic Detection**: System automatically detects bag type from product category and applies appropriate holding/wearing posture.

### ✅ 7. Scalability Features

**Request Tracking:**
- Unique request IDs for every request
- Processing time tracking
- Complete request metadata in responses

**Resource Management:**
- Image size limits prevent memory issues
- Product image count limits (max 5)
- Prompt length validation

**Fallback Mechanisms:**
- Category defaults when Gemini analysis fails
- Sanitized fallback descriptions
- Smart defaults for all configuration values

### ✅ 8. Quality Assurance

**Multiple Validation Layers:**
1. Input validation (files, metadata)
2. Prompt validation (quality, completeness)
3. Output validation (image URL validity)
4. Category mapping validation

**Quality Indicators in Metadata:**
- `geminiConfidence`: "high" | "low"
- `usedFallback`: boolean
- `userBodyAvailability`: detected visibility
- `productScaleRatio`: calculated scale
- `processingTime`: performance metric

## Supported Categories

### Full Category Support:

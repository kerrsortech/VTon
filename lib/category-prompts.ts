/**
 * Base prompt template that all category templates extend

const BASE_TEMPLATE = `REFERENCE IMAGES:
- User image: {{USER_IMAGE_URL}} — preserve identity, face, hair, and skin tone EXACTLY.
- Product images: {{PRODUCT_IMAGE_URLS}} — use to reproduce colors, textures, logos, hardware, and scale EXACTLY.

GOAL (CRITICAL):
Create EXACTLY ONE SINGLE photorealistic studio photograph of EXACTLY ONE person (the same person from the user image) wearing/using the product. 
- MUST be ONE person only, NO multiple people, NO multiple poses, NO duplicate subjects, NO clones
- MUST be a single, natural standing pose showcasing the product
- Preserve user identity, facial features, and skin tone exactly
- Output MUST be a single realistic image with one person in one pose only

MANDATORY FIDELITY RULES:
1) Face & identity preservation:
   - Preserve EXACT facial features, bone structure, hairline, facial hair, and skin tone from the user image.
   - DO NOT alter face shape, facial hair, or hairstyle.
   - Skin tone must match exactly across face, neck, hands, and all visible body parts.
2) Product fidelity:
   - Reproduce product color, texture, and hardware EXACTLY from product images.
   - Keep logos readable and at correct location/scale.
   - Match product dimensions and proportions to reference images.
3) SINGLE PERSON ENFORCEMENT (CRITICAL):
   - MUST generate EXACTLY ONE person in the image - NO exceptions
   - NO multiple people, NO multiple poses, NO duplicate subjects, NO clones, NO overlapping figures
   - NO composite images with multiple views/poses of the same person
   - NO overlapping big foreground crops, NO partial floating limbs
   - The output must be ONE person in ONE natural pose only
4) Scale & anatomical constraints:
   - Person must have realistic adult proportions (approx. 7–8 head heights).
   - If reconstructing body, use standard adult proportions based on face-to-body ratio.
   - All body parts must be anatomically correct and proportional.

IDENTITY & POSE:
Extracted user characteristics: {{USER_CHARACTERISTICS_JSON}}. Preserve these identity attributes EXACTLY: face shape, facial hair, hairline, eye shape, and skin tone.

CRITICAL GENDER SPECIFICATION:
The person in the generated image MUST be {{USER_GENDER}} (unless "unknown" is specified, then infer from user photo). When {{USER_GENDER}} is specified as "male" or "female", the physical features, body proportions, and overall appearance must accurately reflect {{USER_GENDER}} characteristics. Use realistic and natural {{USER_GENDER}} anatomical features, bone structure, and body proportions.

{{CATEGORY_SPECIFIC_INSTRUCTIONS}}

Pose & framing (MANDATORY):
- forcePoseChange is true. Ignore the user's original camera angle and pose.
- Target framing: {{TARGET_FRAMING}}
- Pose description: {{POSE_DESCRIPTION}}
- CRITICAL: Generate EXACTLY ONE person in ONE natural pose. NO multiple poses, NO multiple figures, NO composite views.
- The person must be shown in a single, simple standing pose that showcases the product naturally.
- When reconstructing full-body from head-only: build a realistic adult body using neutral fitted clothing (simple t-shirt + tapered pants) with ~7–8 head heights and natural proportions. Still only ONE person in ONE pose.
- ALWAYS replace background with studio: {{BACKGROUND_INSTRUCTION}}

SCALE CONSTRAINT (MANDATORY):
- Match product size to productScaleCategory ({{PRODUCT_SCALE_CATEGORY}}) and productScaleRatioToHead ({{PRODUCT_SCALE_RATIO}}).
- Target product width ≈ {{PRODUCT_SCALE_RATIO}} × user's head width (use face width from user image).
- Do not exceed +/- 20% of this target.
- If product would be larger than real-life proportions, reduce camera focal length or zoom out.

{{CLOTHING_SWAP_INSTRUCTIONS}}

PHOTOGRAPHY SPECIFICATIONS:
- Camera hint (apply exactly): {{CAMERA_HINT}}
- Studio background: {{BACKGROUND_INSTRUCTION}}
- Lighting: softbox key + soft fill, gentle rim light to separate subject from background.
- Lens: 50–85mm equivalent. Depth of field: slight background blur but both face and product in acceptable focus.
- Output look: Photorealistic, natural skin texture (no plastic smoothing), high-resolution (2K quality).
- Logo placement rule: NEVER add logos or text onto reflective surfaces (lenses, shiny metal) unless the product reference clearly shows the logo at that exact location.

NEGATIVE PROMPT (MANDATORY):
{{NEGATIVE_PROMPT}}

GENERATOR CONTROL & QUALITY:
- Use strong guidance scale / high fidelity (high guidance / low denoising).
- Generate 1–3 variations and select the most anatomically consistent.
- If face is modified or duplicates appear, automatically retry with higher guidance and different seed.

PRODUCT CATEGORY: {{PRODUCT_CATEGORY}}
PRODUCT SCALE CATEGORY: {{PRODUCT_SCALE_CATEGORY}}

IMAGE GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS FROM ANALYSIS:

- Single realistic studio photograph with one person wearing the product
- Natural standing pose showcasing the product clearly
- Clean studio background, professional product photography style`

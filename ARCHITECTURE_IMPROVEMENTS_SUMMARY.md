# Virtual Try-On Architecture Improvements - Summary

## Overview
Enhanced the virtual try-on system with category-aware architecture for consistent, production-ready results across all supported product categories.

## Key Changes

### 1. Category Mapping System (`lib/category-system.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Automatically maps detected product categories to standardized types
- **Features**:
  - Maps any product category to 8 standardized types: HEADWEAR, CLOTHING_UPPER, CLOTHING_LOWER, CLOTHING_FULL, FOOTWEAR, ACCESSORY_BODY, ACCESSORY_CARRY, ACCESSORY_OTHER
  - Provides category-specific configuration (framing, camera settings, scale ratios, poses)
  - Determines body reconstruction needs based on category + user photo
  - Category-specific studio background and negative prompts

### 2. Category-Specific Prompt Templates (`lib/category-prompts.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Provides optimized prompts for each category type
- **Features**:
  - Base template with category-specific instructions
  - Category-specific framing, pose, and clothing swap rules
  - Enhanced instructions per category type (e.g., footwear requires full-body, headwear focuses on face)
  - Automatic prompt building with all placeholders filled

### 3. Enhanced Product Analysis (`app/api/analyze-product/route.ts`)
- **Improvements**:
  - Constrained Gemini to recognize supported category types
  - Better framing rules per product category
  - More specific category detection guidance
  - Maintains all existing analysis features while improving accuracy

### 4. Category-Aware Try-On Route (`app/api/try-on/route.ts`)
- **Improvements**:
  - Maps detected category to standardized type
  - Uses category-specific config as smart defaults
  - Falls back to Gemini analysis when available, uses category defaults otherwise
  - Category-specific prompts for consistent results
  - Enhanced metadata in response for debugging

### 5. Enhanced Body Detection (`lib/prompt-helpers.ts`)
- **Improvements**:
  - Better detection using image dimensions and aspect ratio
  - Filename-based fallback for reliability
  - Sync version for server-side use

## How It Works

### Flow:
1. **User uploads photo** → System detects body availability (head-only/upper-body/full-body)
2. **Product analysis** → Gemini analyzes product image and detects category
3. **Category mapping** → Detected category mapped to standardized type (HEADWEAR, FOOTWEAR, etc.)
4. **Category config** → System loads category-specific settings:
   - Target framing (full-body, three-quarter, head-and-shoulders, etc.)
   - Camera hint (focal length, positioning)
   - Scale ratios and category
   - Pose description
   - Background priority
5. **Smart defaults** → If Gemini analysis succeeds, use it; otherwise use category defaults
6. **Prompt building** → Build category-specific prompt with all optimizations
7. **Image generation** → SeeDream-4 generates image using category-optimized prompt

### Category-Specific Optimizations:

**HEADWEAR** (Sunglasses, Caps, Hats):
- Framing: head-and-shoulders
- Camera: 85mm portrait, tight framing
- Focus: Face and headwear prominent
- Body reconstruction: Not needed

**FOOTWEAR** (Shoes, Sneakers, Boots):
- Framing: full-body (mandatory)
- Camera: 50mm full-body, feet in foreground
- Focus: Feet and shoes clearly visible
- Body reconstruction: Required if user photo doesn't have full body

**CLOTHING_UPPER** (T-Shirts, Jackets, Hoodies):
- Framing: three-quarter body
- Camera: 50-85mm three-quarter shot
- Focus: Upper body garment clearly visible
- Body reconstruction: Only if needed for complete view

**CLOTHING_LOWER** (Pants, Jeans, Shorts):
- Framing: full-body (mandatory)
- Camera: 50mm full-body
- Focus: Lower body garment clearly visible
- Body reconstruction: Required if user photo doesn't have full body

**ACCESSORY_BODY** (Watches, Jewelry):
- Framing: mid-shot or head-and-shoulders (depends on type)
- Camera: 85mm mid-shot for watches, head-and-shoulders for jewelry
- Focus: Accessory prominently displayed
- Body reconstruction: Not needed

**ACCESSORY_CARRY** (Bags, Backpacks):
- Framing: three-quarter body
- Camera: 50-85mm three-quarter shot
- Focus: Bag worn naturally, fully visible
- Body reconstruction: Not needed

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: Category-specific prompts ensure uniform quality across all categories
2. **Reliability**: Smart defaults ensure system works even if Gemini analysis fails
3. **Scalability**: Easy to add new categories with predefined configurations
4. **Production-Ready**: Handles edge cases (head-only photos, body reconstruction)
5. **Maintainability**: Centralized category logic, easy to update rules

## Supported Categories

The system now supports all categories in your taxonomy:
- Men's/Women's/Kids' Clothing (all subcategories)
- Men's/Women's/Kids' Footwear (all subcategories)
- Bags (all subcategories)
- Jewelry (all subcategories)
- Watches (all subcategories)
- Eyewear (all subcategories)
- Headwear (all subcategories)
- Belts, Scarves, Gloves, Socks, Ties (all subcategories)

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **No breaking changes** - All existing functionality preserved
✅ **Enhanced fallbacks** - Better defaults when analysis fails
✅ **Improved quality** - Category-specific optimizations
✅ **Same API** - Response format unchanged (with additional metadata)

## Next Steps (Optional Future Enhancements)

1. Async body detection using image analysis API
2. Category-specific model fine-tuning
3. A/B testing for prompt variations
4. Category-specific retry logic
5. Performance monitoring per category

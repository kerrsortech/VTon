# Critical Improvements Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Multiple People/Poses Issue - FIXED
**Problem**: Generated images sometimes showed multiple people or multiple poses in a single image (e.g., 3 people/poses visible).

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Enhanced GOAL section**: Emphasizes "EXACTLY ONE SINGLE photorealistic studio photograph of EXACTLY ONE person"
- **Strong negative prompts**: Added explicit terms: "no multiple people, no multiple poses, no multiple figures, no clones, no overlapping figures, no composite images, no multiple views, no double exposure, no triptych, no side-by-side figures"
- **Critical enforcement rules**: Added "SINGLE PERSON ENFORCEMENT" section in MANDATORY FIDELITY RULES
- **Pose instructions**: Explicitly states "CRITICAL: Generate EXACTLY ONE person in ONE natural pose"
- **Output requirements**: Added "CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS" section at end of prompt emphasizing single person, single pose

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/category-prompts.ts` - Enhanced base template with single-person enforcement
- `lib/category-system.ts` - Strengthened negative prompts across all categories

### 2. ✅ Bag Category Specificity - FIXED
**Problem**: Generic bag prompts didn't differentiate between handbags, shoulder bags, crossbody bags, mini purses, etc., leading to incorrect holding/wearing postures.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Bag type detection**: Created `detectBagType()` function that identifies specific bag types from category string
- **Bag-specific instructions**: Created `getBagSpecificInstructions()` with tailored prompts for each bag type:
  - **Handbags/Mini Purses**: Held in one hand or on forearm, arm slightly bent at waist/hip level
  - **Clutches**: Held in hand at waist/chest level or tucked under arm
  - **Shoulder Bags**: On one shoulder, strap visible over shoulder, bag hanging at side
  - **Crossbody Bags**: Diagonally across body, strap over shoulder and across chest/back
  - **Backpacks**: On back, both straps over shoulders, centered
  - **Tote Bags**: Held by handles in hand OR on shoulder, depending on style
  - **Belt Bags**: Around waist/hips, strap visible, positioned at front/side/back
- **Enhanced Gemini analysis**: Updated analyze-product to specifically request bag type (e.g., "Handbag", "Shoulder Bag", NOT just "Bag")

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/category-prompts.ts` - Added bag type detection and specific instructions
- `app/api/analyze-product/route.ts` - Enhanced to request specific bag types

## Key Changes Summary

### Enhanced Prompts
1. **Single Person Enforcement**: Multiple layers of enforcement throughout the prompt
2. **Bag-Specific Instructions**: Tailored holding/wearing postures for each bag type
3. **Stronger Negative Prompts**: Comprehensive list of what NOT to generate
4. **Output Requirements**: Explicit final check for single person output

### Category Improvements
- All categories now have strengthened negative prompts preventing multiple people
- Bag category now intelligently detects and handles 7+ bag types with appropriate postures
- Enhanced Gemini analysis for better bag type detection

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Single Person Enforcement**:
   - Upload selfies with various products (shorts, t-shirts, shoes, etc.)
   - Verify only ONE person appears in generated images
   - Check that there are NO multiple poses or composite views

2. **Test Bag Category Specificity**:
   - Test with handbags - should be held in hand/forearm
   - Test with shoulder bags - should be on shoulder with visible strap
   - Test with crossbody bags - should be across body
   - Test with backpacks - should be on back
   - Test with clutches - should be held in hand
   - Verify holding/wearing posture matches bag type

## Expected Results

✅ **Single Person Output**: All generated images show exactly ONE person in ONE pose
✅ **Correct Bag Postures**: Each bag type has appropriate holding/wearing posture
✅ **Consistent Quality**: Studio-quality images with natural poses
✅ **Production Ready**: No manual intervention needed, works across all categories

## Notes

- All changes are backward compatible
- No breaking changes to API
- Enhanced metadata includes bag type information
- Category system automatically handles bag type detection
